# qubes-management
This repo is the future home of Qubes Management after the code has been cleaned up for public release. Qubes Management provides multiple small utilities that help make running Qubes easier and more secure. Designed for serious Qubers that have basic technical knowledge. The utilities can be used a-la-carte as it fits and more are being worked on.

Current Qubes Management utilities (more coming):
- incremental backup with borg and restic* / wyng*
	- multi repos, per-vm config, incremental, encrypted, etc
- create qubes and install software / configure with presets provided
- shutdown idle qubes automatically
- enforce workspace / window attachment
- power warning handling

\* planned for future
